<h1 align="center">Vaccin HPV Info</h1>
<h3 align="center">A medical prevention website built with Next.js and Prismic</h3>

## About

This is the code behind the medical prevention website [Vaccin HPV Info](https://vaccin-hpv-info.fr/) (French only).  
This is shared as an example of a Next.js + Prismic architecture

## Features

**React.js hooks**

- The best way to handle state in React.

**Next.js**

- Makes the Server Side Rendering and development of React apps a pleasure.

**Prismic CMS**

- Almost all the content of the website can be modified on the CMS with no redevelopment.

**Semantic UI React**

- The composable front end framework Semantic UI adapted for React.

**Next SEO**

- Populate each page header metadata with name, description, image, etc.

**Deployment**

- Ready to deploy on Vercel using git integration or the command line

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/remidebette/vaccin-hpv-info && yarn && yarn dev
```

## Usage

### Development

Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000.

```
yarn dev
```

### Build

Build for production: next.js automatically renders static HTML pages when possible. Then if you deploy on Vercel you can have both statically rendered pages and server-side rendered pages (as lambdas functions).

```
yarn build
```

Launch a server for server-side rendering (after building the application):

```
npm start
```

Generate a fully static project with pre-rendered pages to put directly on a server or any static website hosting platform. Note that you lose the possibility to have server-side rendered pages. With Vercel you should not have to run this command.

```
yarn export
```
